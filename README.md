# Password_Generator

## Author: alligatormonday (Joseph Jepson)

## Description: 

Submission for my third assignment within the Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp via University of Arizona. 

In this assignment, I needed to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The assignment featured clean and polished HTML and CSS code to allow for the user interface to be responsive. My task was to use JavaScript to provide the user a randomly generated password with the following parameters:
* When the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button, the user is presented with a series of prompts.
* The user then selects which criteria to include in the password. 
    * Length of password. At least 8 characters and nor more than 128 characters. 
    * At least one of the following character types; lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 
* User input should be validated.
* Once all prompts have been answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. 
* The password generated is displayed on the page. 

In my approach to this assignment, I first made an active and deliberate choice to commit to myself that _I would not_ spend more than 8-10 hours on this assignment. In assignments one and two, for this Bootcamp, I spent more time on completing and perfecting the assignment than I should have. Time management was very important to me, in addition to completing the _assignment criteria_ when submitting the homework. 

The first step I took in order to start this assignment was to begin **pseudo-coding** the process for how I wanted this application to work. I've left most of my pseudo-code in the JavaScript file for you to see how I was thinking through this. I left some of my _console-log_ as well. 

This was the first assignment where I meaningfully attempted to pseudo-code. Going through this process helped me organize my thoughts and in which order I ought to start. From there, I could break the process of creating the password generator into small pieces. 

I struggled a bit with validating the user input. After thinking through it, I landed on a solution that seemingly works. This way when the user does not input the required character parameters then they receive an alert stating that they need to make a password with the stated requirements. 

Overall this was a very challenging assignment. I received a fair amount of assistance from my tutor and one of our class TAs. I can forsee me struggling with JavaScript and the upcoming knowledge bases in the Bootcamp if I don't have a strong foundational understanding. Going through this assignment helped make some of the JS syntax more clear, but I still have a lot of work and studying to do.
